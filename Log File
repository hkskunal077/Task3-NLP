1. First we have imported all most important Data Science Libraries.
2. We read the data uploaded on Google Colab Session Storage.
3. We did Exploratory Data Analysis to prepare and clean the data.
4. We visualized data for seeing where the data is not present.
5. Then we used Plot Bar to see which products are most purchased.
6. Then for cleaning the data we derived out some of the most important features.
7. We have set Description as our main feature.
8. From the Product Category Tree we extracted all catergories and figured that primary category is most relevant.
9. Then we clean the data to extract required features for machine learnaing and NLP Tasks.
10. We separated the category tree into different categories.
11. then we added all the categories separately as columns
12. Then we imported required Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Libraries.
13. Then using MULTINOMILANB() Naive Bayes created different models of classifers.
14. Accuracy comes out to be 91%.
15. Then We used Product Specification as main feature and accuracy rosed to 92%.
16. Some of the possible way to increase accuracy  is to use MultiClass Logistic Regression.
or we can use combination of features as Main Feature.
